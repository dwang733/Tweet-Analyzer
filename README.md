# Tweet Analyzer

This project runs a local web server using Flask, where a user can log in with Twitter using OAuth.
Then, the user can search for tweets from their profile page, and tweets will be highlighted with different colors
based on sentiment analysis. We also use PostgreSQL to store users so they don't have to repeatedly login.
